    <h1>
        For my raster project, I choose to create a
vintage style collage. I prefer making a collage
in many different old magazine covers, newspapers
and maps. After that, I put my selfie
in middle of one of this old magazine cover
which was the challenge part for me. I have
felt satisfied for what I have done. I believe
that I was succeed with the raster project.
