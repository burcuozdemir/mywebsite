    <h1>
       For my Illustration project, I have decided to create my
old magazine cover which was connected with my first
project. I was always into drawing profile woman face
that was the reason at the beginning that I have chosen
to draw this woman profile. And I have used this photo
that I have took before as a background to draw this
woman profile. After all, I have put all the items together
on this photoshop program and that was result
of what I have created.
